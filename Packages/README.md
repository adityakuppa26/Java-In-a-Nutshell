# Packages
  
* These are containers for classes that are used to keep the class namespace compartmentalized.  
* It is both a naming ad a visibility control mechanism.  
* Defining a package :
```
package package_name;
... classes ......

Any class written under it is saved in that package.
```
* JAVA uses file system directories to store packages.
