# Java-In-a-Nutshell
  
**Motivation**
  
* Need for a platform independent language to embed in various consumer systems.  
* WWW ( World Wide Web) originated at the same time boosted java development further.  
  
**Java Applets** 
  
* An applet is a special program transmitted over the internet which is automatically executed by a JAVA compatible browser.  
* Dynamic, self-executing program.  
* Carries out basic functions like displaying data, handling user data , simple functions etc.  

**Bytecode**
  
* JAVA compiler generates bytecode ( highly optimised intermediate code).  
* It can be executed by JVMs of various kinda of systems.  
* Achieves Portability : bytecode geberated on one system can be executed in any other system ( JVM is implemented differently for differnt systems.)  

**JVM**
  
* A java runtime environment which contains the entire java program and prevents any side effects outside it.  
* Contains JIT(Just in time) compiler which compiles selected portions of bytecode to native code in real time by performing various run-time checks.  

**Servlet**

* A small program that executed on server to provide some basic functionality. ( similar to applets on clients)  
* Used to create dynamic content at the server side, which is then sent to the client side.  

**Buzzwords**

* Simple : Easy to learn and use   
* Object-Oriented : treats everything as an object in the object model.  
* Robust : written programs execute in a predictable manner  ; reliable ; free from common errors ; strictly typed language  
* Architecture-Neutral : programs execute independent of underlying architecture.  
* Multithreaded : programs can do multiple things simultaneously.  
* Interpreted and high performance : unlike most interpreted languages , java achieves high performance even though it uses bytecode.
